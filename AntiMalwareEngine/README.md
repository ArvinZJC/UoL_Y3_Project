# [UoL_Y3_Project](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/UoL_Y3_Project)/AntiMalwareEngine

This project is named as **Anti-Malware Engine** which contains PY files to extract features from an app and apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train and test a model. It just provides an idea on how to classify apps as benign or malicious ones.

## ATTENTION

1. By 16 April 2020, everything looks good with VS Code + Python 3.7.7. Additionally, no less than 8GB free memory is required.
2. You can type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` into the command prompt under the root directory of the project to simplify the pip installation.
3. The trained model is saved in CHECKPOINT files using Tensorflow. However, due to the large file size, these files are not included here.
